  <p>
    I am a Ph.D. student in Prof. <a href="https://people.duke.edu/~sf59/">Sina Farsiu</a>'s Vision and Image Processing (VIP) Laboratory at Duke University. My research focuses on developing advanced computer vision and deep learning algorithms in medical imaging to facilitate earlier disease detection, enhance treatment precision, and support clinical trials and practice. Currently, I am particularly interested in image registration, mosaicking, and automatic analysis techniques in biomedical optics to improve corneal and retinal imaging. Previously, I also gained experience in computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis under the guidance of Prof. <a href="http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~qdou/">Qi Dou</a>, Prof. <a href="https://citi-imr.sjtu.edu.cn/">Guoyan Zheng</a> and Prof. <a href="https://mihi.sjtu.edu.cn/index.html">Xiaohua Qian</a>.
